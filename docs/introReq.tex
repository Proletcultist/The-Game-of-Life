\begin{itemize}
	\item "Product" - software-hardware complex, developed in this project.
	\item "Cellular automaton" - state machine presented with game field divided by cells. Every cell has 8 neighbours and can be dead or alive.
	\item "UART" - Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter from \href{https://github.com/cdm-processors/logisim-uart}{this} repository.
