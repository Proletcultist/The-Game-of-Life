For building purposes you need:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://github.com/Proletcultist/cdm-devkit-macro-improvements}{This} fork of CdM-devkit
	\item Some make implementation (such as GNU make)
\end{itemize}

You can build all with \texttt{make all}. Also, you can build only tests with \texttt{make tests} or only main programm with \texttt{make main}. To add new test just add any .asm file you want to src/Tests directory (your test should provide some implementation for main function).

For debugging purposes use \texttt{make $<$test name$>.debug$}. You should provide name of test from src/Tests directory (without extension .asm). As a result, you will have .img in bin/Tests and debug info file in debug/
