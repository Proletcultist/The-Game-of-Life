Product realise cellular automaton with 32x32 game field and set of rules, including:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Born} - set of integers from 0 to 8, specifying, with what amount of alive neighbours cell will become alive.
	\item \textbf{Surv} - set of integers from 0 to 8, specifying, with what amount of alive neighbours cell will survive.
	\item \textbf{Speed} - integer from 0 to 3, specifying game speed.
\end{itemize}

CdM-16 processor has the ability to communicate with cellular automaton, within this communication processor can read and modify automaton state.

Product allows user to connect to it with external terminal through UART. With this connection user can do following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Modify game field
	\item Modify rules
	\item Control game flow, start or pause game, trigger single iteration of game
	\item Save and paste templates (some part specified part of game field, stored in one of 5 slots)
\end{itemize}
