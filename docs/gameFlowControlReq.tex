\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Game flow control}

In order to control game flow you can use following commands:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textsf{play} - run game
	\item \textsf{pause} - stop game
	\item \textsf{step} - make one iteration of game
\end{itemize}

By using these commands you can stop game anytime, edit something and then run it again, so ability of editing goes beyond just creating first generation and simply observe its evolution, you can interrupt this evolution and change anything you want.
