In our product template is some part of game field state (or whole game field state) saved to "slot" in memory (there are 5 slots) for later loading it to any place on game field (only if template fit by size in this place). Also, once saved, slot can be rewrited with another template.

In order to operate templates you can use following commands:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textsf{save $n$ $x_{1}$ $y_{1}$ $x_{2}$ $y_{2}$} - Save all cells in rectangle with upper left corner ($x_{1}$, $y_{1}$) and lower right corner ($x_{2}$, $y_{2}$) to slot number $n$.
	\item \textsf{load $n$ $x$ $y$} - Copy all cells from slot $n$ to rectangle with upper left corner ($x_{1}$, $y_{1}$) (note: this will be done only if template fits by size in specified place)
	\item \textsf{getTemplates} - get all saved templates printed on external terminal.
\end{itemize}

There are three default templates, saved in first three slots (all of them work on standard rules: S23B3):

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Glider - small dynamic structure, running diagonlly.
	\item Spaceship - medium-sized dynamic structure, running horizontally.
	\item Blinkers generator - generates four blinkers placed in "cross" manner.
\end{enumerate}
